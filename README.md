# Hotel Management Website
 My first project that i got in my first year of BScIT. It's UI is not good as it was my first website and i had spent days learning the things and applying it to my website and i know that it is not a good website but it is close to me as it was my first website and made it with Hardwork rather than other people who had done copy paste in their project.

I had given the topic of Hotel Booking System for Project to make a website. So, I made a website according to the project topic of Hotel booking system and named the website ‘HOTEL GURU’ .

In my website, I created the login page with the help of Form tag. My website’s background  colour code is #251e1e. It is Blackish-Brownish colour. In the login page, My Website name is displaying at the left side and login container is displaying at the right side of my website. In the login container, there are input boxes for name and password. I had made those fields required so no one can login without filling those fields. After clicking on the login button, the user will be redirected to the Home page and the data of the user filled in the login form will be stored in the phpMyAdmin database.

After redirecting to the Home page, you can go to the login page again by clicking on the logout option which is on the side of my Home page. The user can open and close the side bar by clicking the toggle button which is on the right side of the page. At the top of the Home page, the name of my website is displaying and below the name there is a search bar which is completely useless for now. Below the Search bar, there are images containing sliders. User can slide the image by clicking on the arrow or by clicking on the dots below. Below the dots, there is an image with the offer for first booking. And at the end of the page, there is a footer of the web page.

If you click on the ‘Hotels’ option, the user will be redirected to the hotels page where the user can book the hotel to stay. There are currently six hotel cards where the user can click and book the hotel. By clicking on the ‘Book Now’, user will get a popup of successful 

booking and the hotel will get booked. All the other things like header, sidebar and footer are same in all the other pages.

After clicking on the About us option, the user will be redirected to the about us page where the information of the website and the founder had been given.

Now, the user will get to see the help page of my website is he clicks on the ‘Help’ option which is in the sidebar. This page will help the user to know the functionality of our website like how to book rooms and many more.

We can get to see the footer at the bottom of the page where the user will be able to see ‘FAQ’ , ‘Contact’ and the copyright page of the website. 

The FAQ page of the website is the same as the Help page and in the contact page, there is a contact form to contact us and give feedback of our service.  There are text boxes for name, email and feedback. After clicking on the submit button, there  will be  a popup ‘Thanks for your feedback’ and the page will be reload. The data filled in the contact form will be stored in the phpMyAdmin database in the contact table.

This was the Quick tour of my website. Hope you like it!
